This repository contains Matlab and C code generated for the lab rotation "Impact of dendritic nonlinearities on dynamics of spatial networks"

This project integrates nonlinear dendritic computation into a recurrent spiking network with spatially dependent connectivity and investigates
its effects on the spatio-temporal dynamics.
The implementation of the network is based on:
Rosenbaum, R., Smith, M. A., Kohn, A., Rubin, J. E., & Doiron, B. (2017). The spatial structure of correlated neuronal variability. Nature neuroscience, 20(1), 107.

To run the code, all of the C code needs to be compiled using the mex compiler.
When the C files are compiled, the simulations can be started using the matlab code.

This repository contains Matlab and C code generated for the lab rotation "Impact of dendritic nonlinearities on dynamics of spatial networks"

To run the code, all of the C code needs to be compiled using the mex compiler.
When the C files are compiled, the simulations can be started using the matlab code.
